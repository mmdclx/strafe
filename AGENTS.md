# AGENTS.md

## Read First
- Always read this file when starting work in this repo.

## Linear Is the Source of Truth
- Most work should be tied to a Linear issue in the "Strafe — Gesture Tab Switching MVP" project.
- Small housekeeping tasks (e.g., README tweaks, doc moves, asset adds) can be done without a Linear issue.
- If it's unclear whether a task is minor, ask before proceeding.
- Keep the issue updated as you work: status, findings, and next steps.

## New Ideas
- When you notice new work, suggest adding it as a Linear issue and get approval before creating it.

## What to Work on Next
- When choosing the next task, review the project's Linear issues and prioritize based on status and priority.
